// You are given an integer array score of size n, where score[i] is the score of the ith athlete in a competition. All the scores are guaranteed to be unique.
// The athletes are placed based on their scores, where the 1st place athlete has the highest score, the 2nd place athlete has the 2nd highest score, and so on.
// The placement of each athlete determines their rank:

// The 1st place athlete's rank is "Gold Medal".
// The 2nd place athlete's rank is "Silver Medal".
// The 3rd place athlete's rank is "Bronze Medal".
// For the 4th place to the nth place athlete, their rank is their placement number (i.e., the xth place athlete's rank is "x").
// Return an array answer of size n where answer[i] is the rank of the ith athlete.

// Input: score = [5,4,3,2,1]
// Output: ["Gold Medal","Silver Medal","Bronze Medal","4","5"]
// Explanation: The placements are [1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th].
